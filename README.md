# Snow White 1.0

Welcome to my personal AI assistant repository! This project is built using Python and leverages various technologies such as natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) to create a smart and personalized virtual assistant. The assistant uses the OpenAI API to get responses from a trained model for better accuracy and efficiency.

## Features

This personal AI assistant is under development and it contains features like:

- NLP
- OpenAI API integration
- Saves your chat and it remembers you
- Search the web
- Play music and videos
- Create reminders
- Answer general knowledge questions
- and much more!

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once you have Python installed, clone this repository to your local machine using:

```
git clone https://github.com/jithu-francis017/SnowWhite-1.0.git
```

Then, navigate to the repository directory and install the required dependencies using and you can run the personal AI assistant using the following command:

```
python SnowWhite.py
```

## How it Works

The personal AI assistant works by using speech recognition to process voice commands, which are then analyzed using NLP techniques to determine the user's intent. The assistant then uses various APIs and modules, including the OpenAI API, to perform the required actions, such as sending an email or playing a song.

The ML and DL models used in this project have been trained on large datasets to improve the accuracy of the assistant's responses, and the use of the OpenAI API helps to provide even better accuracy and efficiency.
